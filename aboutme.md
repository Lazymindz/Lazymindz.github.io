subtitle: Technology space is changing rapidly. So should you!

Let us start with my name: **Siva Kovvuru** (that’s in short for ‘Venkata Sivarama Raju Kovvuru’).

My eyes lit whenever there’s a conversation around me about:
-	Artificial Intelligence
-	Deep Learning
-	Blockchain
-	Cyber Security
-	Anything cool in general (great modules, frameworks)

**My motto(s)**:
>Every problem can be solved. Follow the principles of [Transfer Learning][1]. Build simplified solutions to complex problems. Believe me, we need not start from scratch.

**Continuous Learning**.
>Technology is evolving at a rapid pace; changing everything we believe is the current standard. I continuously self reassess to try and keep up with it.  

Some of the trainings and certifications I undertook in the recent times (Verifiable certificate Links on LinkedIn):

  - TOGAF 9 Certification on Enterprise Architecture
  - Deep Learning Specialization
  - Decentralised AI : Ethereum, IPFS, Openmined
  - IBM HyperLedger Blockchain Foundation Developer Certification

  *Other Training and Certifications*:
  - Salesforce nCino Certified
  - ISTQB Testing Foundation Level
  - Robotic Process Automation: BluePrism

I spend a part of my spare time listening to ‘AI Podcasts’ (and about Python repositories), and find them a great way to get insights into the latest implementations, algorithms, modules, and improved understanding.

Major chunk of my professional work caters to projects that assist in Cloud Architecture(Azure), Devops, Data Analysis, Automation (Infrastructure, Operational, Test, and RPA), and Testing (Functional and Non-functional).

I currently organise an AI Meetup group in Nottingham, and am keen on making the group as self suistainable as possbile in the future. We intend to work on projects that can make an impact. Visit [Notts.AI](https://notts.ai) for more information.
