### GitHub page of 'Siva Kovvuru'

For those who find it tedious to click each of my repositories for their read-me content, this site should ease some of that trouble.

It also hosts a lot of ways you can find information about me, a quick summary, and a display of Open Source work.

Get going. Click this link: [Siva Kovvuru](https://lazymindz.github.io/)
